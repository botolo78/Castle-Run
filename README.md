# About

Castle Run is a platformer demo created butchering Fort Loop, the game created by Sebastien Benard (Deepnight) for Ludum Dare 47.
The intent was to understand how LDTK works using **Heaps** framework (https://heaps.io) and **Haxe** language (https://haxe.org).

I'm quite sure this implementation is far from acceptable, but it works and it was fun working on it.

Please check and try the wonderful level editor **LDTK** (https://ldtk.io/) Deepnight is workin on.
